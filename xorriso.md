# xorriso
 xorriso is a program which copies file objects from POSIX compliant filesystems into  Rock
Ridge  enhanced  ISO  9660  filesystems  and  performs  session-wise  manipulation of such
filesystems. It can load the management information of existing ISO images and  it  writes
the session results to optical media or to filesystem objects.
Vice versa xorriso is able to copy file objects out of ISO 9660 filesystems.

A  special  property  of  xorriso  is that it needs neither an external ISO 9660 formatter
program nor an external burn program for  CD,  DVD  or  BD  but  rather  incorporates  the
libraries of libburnia-project.org .
