# Avahi 

Avahi is a free Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to. It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

Avahi technology is dependent on the mDNS and DNS-SD protocols and allows machines to

- publish services and hosts running on a local network, and
- discover services and hosts running on a local network. 

The local network is assumed to be trusted. A firewall should should permit multicast traffic on port 5353.
