# md5sum Command 

Suppose, anyone wants to install an operating system , so to verify if it’s correct CD, it’s always a good idea to verify .iso file using MD5 checksum, so that you don’t end up installing wrong software (some sort of virus which can corrupt your filesystem).

md5sum is a computer program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 hashes, as described in RFC 1321. The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file. As with all such hashing algorithms, there is theoretically an unlimited number of files that will have any given MD5 hash. However, it is very unlikely that any two non-identical files in the real world will have the same MD5 hash, unless they have been specifically created to have the same hash.[1]
